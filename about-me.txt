I am **Danyal Sarfraz**.

Born and raised in Brooklyn. 

Growing up I went to _The College Partnership Elementary School_ also recognized as Public School 247. After graduating elementary school with moderate grades I decided to take a foot in the right direction by working harder in
middle school. 

For my middle school years I attended _Seth Low Intermediate School 96_. The school wasn't the best but it gave me many opportunities. I was able to receive honors credits for my academics and I also was recognized as a honor
roll student
