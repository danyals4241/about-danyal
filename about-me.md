#### What schools did I go to?
Growing up I went to _The College Partnership Elementary School_ also recognized as Public School 247. After graduating elementary school with moderate grades I decided to take a foot in the right direction by working harder in
middle school. 

For my middle school years I attended _Seth Low Intermediate School 96_. The school wasn't the best but it gave me many opportunities. I was able to receive honors credits for my academics and I also was recognized as a honor
roll student

Now I attend **_Highschool of Telecommunication Arts and Technology_**. The experience so far is great. Teachers are very helpful and the school environment is decent. Not the best but definitely not the worst. I enjoy the benefits provided to honors students.

#### A poem that I found interesting:

_Be Proud of Who You Are_

I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows.  
I am who I am from my head to my toes.   
I tend to get loud when speaking my mind.   
Even a little crazy some of the time.   
I'm not a size 5 and don't care to be.   
You can be you and I can be me.   
I try to stay strong when pain knocks me down.   
And the times that I cry is when no ones around.   
To error is human or so that's what they say.   
Well tell me who's perfect anyway.
